Virus Detection and Neutralization System
A C-based program for detecting and neutralizing viruses in binary files using a signature-based approach. The system supports:

Loading virus signatures from formatted files (VIRL/VIRB).
Detecting viruses in files by scanning for known signatures.
Neutralizing infections by overwriting detected virus signatures.
Displaying virus information (name, size, and signature) interactively.
Includes a user-friendly menu-driven interface and robust memory management.
